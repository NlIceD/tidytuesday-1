# #TidyTuesday

## What is it all about?

Excerpt from the official [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project on GitHub:

The #tidytuesday project is a weekly data project aimed at the `R` ecosystem. An emphasis will be placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

## Code

This repository is a collection of some code snippets used for wrangling, aggregating and visualizing data with `tidyverse` to create a meaningful insight about the underlying weekly data sets.

**Important**: _The code is minimalized and it's focus is to show how data is prepared, aggregated and visualized (without distraction of styling and modifying theme, fonts, etc.). The images in this repository are created with the code shown here with additional theme modifications._
